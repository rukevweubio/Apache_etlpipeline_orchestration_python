With a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and quality service, Zipco Food aims to leverage advanced data
and engineering solutions to enhance operational efficiency, improve product offerings, and boost profitability.



## business statement 
zipco Food generates a significant amount of data daily, which is currently underutilized due to inefficient data handling and analysis processes.
The primary challenge is the disparate nature of data collection and storage,with critical sales and inventory information scattered 
across multiple CSV files without a unified system for aggregation and analysis. This fragmentation leads to operational inefficiencies,
including delays in data access, difficulty in obtaining real-time insights, and challenges in maintaining data integrity and accuracy.


## Objectives:
1. Implement a Streamlined ETL Pipeline: Develop and automate an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline to improve data processing efficiency and ensure data consistency across the organization.
2. Design a Scalable Database Schema: Create a database schema that supports efficient data retrieval and scalability while adhering to 2NF/3NF normalization standards.
3. Develop a System for Real-Time Analysis:Build a system capable of real-time data analysis to aid in the decision-making process and enhance operational responsiveness.
4. Ensure Robust Data Governance and Compliance: Establish strong data governance and compliance through effective version control and data orchestration practices.

## Benefits:
1. Enhanced Data Consistency:A streamlined ETL pipeline will reduce errors and inconsistencies in data, ensuring more reliable insights.
2. Improved Data Retrieval and Scalability: A well-designed database schema will optimize data retrieval processes, supporting the companyâ€™s growth and scalability.
3. Faster Decision-Making: Real-time analysis will empower the team to make informed decisions quickly, improving operational efficiency and responsiveness.
4. Strengthened Data Integrity and Compliance: Robust data governance will maintain data integrity, support regulatory compliance, and ensure accurate and secure data management.
5. Enhanced Decision-Making Capabilities: Improve decision-making through real-time, accurate data analysis, providing actionable insights promptly.
6. Improved Operational Efficiency: Reduce labor and operational costs by automating data processes, leading to streamlined workflows.
7. Greater Scalability and Flexibility: Achieve scalability and flexibility in data management, accommodating future business growth and evolving needs.
8. Strengthened Data Integrity and Reliability: Ensure high-quality information and strategic planning by enhancing data integrity and reliability.

## Tech Stack:
1. Python: Utilized for scripting the ETL process, data cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks, leveraging powerful libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
2. SQL: Employed for querying, updating, and managing the database stored in Azure Blob Storage, ensuring efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
3. Azure Blob Storage: Chosen for its scalability and reliability, serving as the centralized data repository for storing processed data.
4. GitHub: Used for version control, enabling collaboration, development, and maintenance of ETL scripts and project documentation.
5. Apache Airflow: Orchestrates the ETL process, efficiently scheduling jobs and monitoring the workflow as data progresses through various stages of the pipeline.
